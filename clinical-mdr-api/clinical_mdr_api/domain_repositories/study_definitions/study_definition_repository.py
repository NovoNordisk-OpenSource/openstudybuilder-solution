    """
    Abstract Study Repository. Abstract class meant to be a base for concrete study repository implementation.
    A class provides public repository methods for Study persistence and retrieval and implements all relevant
    Memento pattern interactions with the StudyDefinitionAR class for getting StudySnapshots for save and for
    StudyDefinitionAR creation from StudyDefinitionSnapshot retrieved from repository as well as tracking of
    StudyDefinitionAR instances declared as retrieved with intent of updating.

    Concrete repository implementation is expected to:
    * provide implementation for _retrieve_snapshot_by_uid, _save, _create and _retrieve_all_snapshots methods
    (see details in abstract method
        docstrings)
    * if necessary provide a constructor with some necessary initializations (possibly injecting some dependencies, e.g.
        some transaction manager object). It's assumed that every request served creates its own instance of this class.
        NOTE: if provided, subclass constructor is expected to call super().__init__(), to allow base class to init
        properly as well.
    * if necessary override a close lifecycle method to do some cleanup or finalization (and again if that's the case
        a super().close() also should be invoked).
