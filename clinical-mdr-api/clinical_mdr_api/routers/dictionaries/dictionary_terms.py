State before:
 - uid must exist and dictionary term must exist in status draft.
 
Business logic:
 - The existing dictionary term is updated.
 - The individual values for name and uid must all be unique values within the dictionary codelist.
 - The status of the updated version will continue to be 'Draft'.
 - The 'version' property of the version will automatically be incremented with +0.1.
 - The 'change_description' property is required.
 
State after:
 - Attribute are updated for the dictionary term.
 - Audit trail entry must be made with update of attributes.
 
Possible errors:
 - Invalid uid.
