Feature: Manage Library Concept Activities in Clinical MDR API

    As a API user, I want to manage the Activities in the Concepts Library API endpoints

    Background: Test user must be able to call the Clinical MDR API and the test data exists
        Given The test user can call the Clinical MDR API

    Scenario: User must be able to get all the studies when calling the API endpoint '/studies/structure-overview'
        When the user calls the API endpoint '/studies/structure-overview'
        Then the response must include all studies

    Scenario: User must be able to get activity details
        When the user requests to get the details of an activity with a specific UID
        Then the response should include the following attributes for the activity:

    Scenario: User must be able to create a new activity
        Given the user provides the necessary details for a new activity
        When the user attempts to create a new activity
        Then the system should verify the uniqueness of the activity name and perform the necessary actions to add the activity
        And the system should reject the creation if an activity with the same name already exists
