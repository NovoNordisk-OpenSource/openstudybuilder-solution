# RESTful API endpoints used by consumers that want to extract data from StudyBuilder
# This file is a placeholder for version 2 of the consumer api,
# and should be replaced by the real v2 code once that needs to be implemented.

# Example v2 endpoint.
# GET endpoint to retrieve a list of studies.
# An endpoint with the same path also exists in v1.
# But since no breaking changes can be allowed in the consumer api,
# any change that could break existing consumers requires that
# a new version of the endpoint is created.
# A breaking change is anything that modifies the existing content of the response.
# Only changes that add additional content within the response are considered
# non-breaking.
