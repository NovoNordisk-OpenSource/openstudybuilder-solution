- [ ] Each `migrations/migration_{id}.py` script starts with common migration functions (creating indexes/constraints/config values), followed by release-specific migration functions
- [ ] Each migration function is covered by test(s) that migrate test data in `old` format to `new` format 
- [ ] Sufficient test data in `old` format is defined in `tests/data/db_before_migration_{id}.py` file, generated by extracting relevant subgraph from production-like environment
- [ ] `pipenv run migrate` is idempotent, i.e. can be run multiple times without any errors or negative side-effects
