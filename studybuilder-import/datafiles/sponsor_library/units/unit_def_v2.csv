For recombinant FVIII IR is usually 2%, meaning that FVIII activity in the patient will increase with 2% for every 1 IU infused per kg  meaning a HA patient receiving 50 IU/kg can expect FVIII activity of 100%

From Wikipedia
The metabolic equivalent of task (MET), or simply metabolic equivalent, is a physiological concept expressing the energy cost of physical activities[1] as multiples of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and is defined as the ratio of metabolic rate (and therefore the rate of energy consumption) during a specific physical activity to a reference rate of metabolic rate at rest, set by convention to 3.5 ml O2·kg-1·min-1 or equivalently 1 kcal·kg-1· h-1 or 4.184 kJ·kg-1· h-1. By convention 1 MET is considered as the resting metabolic rate obtained during quiet sitting.[2][3] MET values of physical activities range from 0.9 (sleeping) to 18 (running at 17.5 km/h or a 5:31 mile pace).

CDISC Description: The Fahrenheit temperature scale is named after the German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), who proposed it in 1724. In this scale, the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit and the boiling point is 212 degrees, placing the boiling and melting points of water 180 degrees apart. In this scale a degree Fahrenheit is 5/9ths of a Kelvin (or of a degree Celsius), and minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit is equal to minus 40 degrees Celsius. (NCI)
